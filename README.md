# HealthyLifestyle

The Healthy Lifestyle project is an initiative to improve the health of those living in Urban communities though-out America. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Urban communities like Detroit, New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Massachusetts, Seattle and more were disproportionally hit with positive cases and substantial deaths most due to individuals who had underlying health conditions.  Conditions like Diabetes, Hypertension, Heart Decease, Cancer and more.

Living a Healthy Lifestyle means Exercising, Eating Healthy (little or no meat), and eventually being delivered from a life of taking medication.

We will share proven methods that can help you reverse diabetes, aging, cancer, hypertension, heart decease and more.  WE ARE NOT A MEDICAL ORGANIZATION!  However, we are individuals who have achieved success through healthy lifestyle changes and would like to share our truth.
